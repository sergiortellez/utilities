Fontawesome workflow


You can get the exact instructions (with codes and tokens if you activate your kit for npm acces in the config of the kit (on the website) 

1. Configure access for your Project

To authenticate when using npm, create a .npmrc file in the root of your project (or wherever your package.json file lives). Then add the following snippet:

    @awesome.me:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
    @fortawesome:registry=https://npm.fontawesome.com/
    //npm.fontawesome.com/:_authToken=YOUR_TOKEN

2. Install Icons in your Project

Once access is set up, you can now install your Font Awesome Kit as a package via npm.

    npm install --save '@awesome.me/kit-YOUR_KIT@latest'

3. Updating your Package

If you add, remove, or edit icons or styles in your Kit, you'll need to update your package to get the latest changes.

    npm update '@awesome.me/kit-YOUR_KIT'
